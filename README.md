## Instructions
1) Open your terminal and call upon the - $ node main.js - file in your command line
2) Watch as the table populates with the current data in the terminal
3) Choose between the “User” or “Admin” functionality by using the up/down keys to toggle between the option choices
4) USERS have two options. They can choose to purchase an item by targeting the items ID number and by choosing the quantity of the item they would like. And you can just choose to “window shop” or view the items in the terminal. Choosing the window Shop items with close the command line.
5) When you reopen the - $ node main.js - file in your command line you will see the quantity of the product that the user chose will be subtracted from the item they chose to purchase.
6) ADMINS have three functions. After choosing the admin option, you must insert “admin” as the password to open the admin command options in your terminal. When typing this password, it will NOT appear in the terminal so be careful not to have any spelling errors and then hit the “enter” key to continue. If you get the password wrong it will prompt you that you have entered the incorrect password and then it will redirect you. If you get the password correct it will bring you to the admin functionality command line. Here you have three options as an admin. You can add a new item and delete any item as well. To add a new item enter the item name, department name, price, and stock quantity. To delete an item, simply select the corresponding ID number. And lastly if you would just like to view the inventory you can select the “just looking” option, this will then end the current command line. To view your addition or subtraction results simple use the - $ node main.js - command to open the terminal function and view the updated results.
